# weather-project
## Description
For this project I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard that listed the five-day forecast for any inputted city. It also displays the search history with clickable links that can take you back to previously searched weather data. This utilizes the OpenWeather One Call API in order to retrieve all of the data.

## User Story
AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index

THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
